# Calculator Telegram Bot

## Description

This is a simple calculator working with Telegram bot. 
Including addition, subtraction, multiplication and division

## Libraries
- This project uses the library introduced on the [Telegram website](https://core.telegram.org/bots/samples#java)
You can find more information about this library [here](https://github.com/rubenlagus/TelegramBots)

- Also uses [SLF4J API Module](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.slf4j/slf4j-api) v1.7.36 and 
[SLF4J NOP Binding](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.slf4j/slf4j-nop) v1.7.36

I recommend using the exact versions

Import the library *.jar* direclty to your project. Depending on the IDE you are using, the process to add a library 
is different, here is a video that may help with [Intellij](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZaH4tjwMYg) or
[Eclipse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWnfHkBgO1I)
